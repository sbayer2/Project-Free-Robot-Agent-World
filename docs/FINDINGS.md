# pseudo-marble — model & initial sandbox findings

Status: the apparatus is complete **and the headline experiment has been run on the
Mac.** F1–F7 record the model and what the **in-sandbox** (Linux CPU, no Mac) tests
established; **F8** is the first real-MuJoCo result (probe-label stability) and
**F9** is the headline `learned_coherence` measurement on real renders — a weak,
seed-unstable positive (read F9 for the honest verdict and the pilot it corrects).

## 1. What the model is

A single shared-latent network that, from multi-view images of an object, emits
three projections of one understanding:

```
images (B, N, H, W, 3)
   └─ encoder: per-view CNN → global avg-pool → Linear → mean over N views → z
        z  ──► behavior head : 21-dim drop/tilt/push outcomes   (the real target)
        z  ──► essence  head : (density, friction, restitution) (aux supervision)
        z  ──► render   head : conv decoder → mean-view image    (appearance)

loss = behavior MSE + 0.3·essence MSE + 1.0·render MSE
```

- **Render head** is a lightweight conv decoder (Linear → seed map → [nearest
  upsample ×2 + Conv] × k → sigmoid), *not* a Gaussian-splat decoder — we measure
  coherence, not photorealism. `image_size` must be `render_seed·2^k`.
- **One architecture, three mirrored backends** from one `ModelConfig`:
  `mlx_net` (canonical trainer, Apple Metal), `numpy_net` (forward-only),
  `torch_net` (CPU, trainable in-sandbox).

### The task it learns
- **Continuous materials** (`MaterialSampler`): a hidden 4-factor essence
  (heaviness/grip/hardness/clarity) generates *both* physics and appearance, with
  noise so appearance is **predictive but not invertible** — the model must infer
  the essence, not look it up.
- **Behavior under action** (`probes.py`): drop (bounce/settle), tilt (slide),
  push (slide vs **topple** — shape × material interact). Outcomes are summary
  stats: toppled, settle_time, slid_distance, n_bounces, max_height, path_length,
  final_tilt_deg.
- **Generalization split** (`RegionHoldout`): a region of essence-space is held
  out for test, so the metric is interpolation/extrapolation, not memorization.

### The measurement (`coherence_bench.py`)
Nudge `z`; if the directions that change the *render* also change the *behavior*,
the heads share structure (coherent) vs. live in private subspaces (~0). Compared
against an **independent baseline** (render-only + behavior-only models with
separate latents, joined as a disjoint latent → ~0 by construction).

## 2. Initial findings from sandbox tests

All numbers below are from a 4-core / 15 GB Linux CPU container, using the numpy
and torch backends. They establish that the **apparatus works**; they are **not**
the scientific result.

![initial sandbox findings](figures/sandbox_findings.png)

*(Figure regenerable from live data with `python scripts/make_figures.py`.)*

### F1 — No usable Linux MLX; numpy/torch fill the gap
The pip `mlx` wheel on Linux x86 is non-functional (missing `libmlx.so`), and
there's no GPU (so cudamat/Theano/CUDA paths are out). NumPy and CPU PyTorch
install and run, which is why the model has three mirrored backends: MLX stays
the canonical Mac trainer; numpy validates forward shapes anywhere; torch CPU
verifies the training loop converges.

### F2 — The authored coupling is real but noisy (as intended)
Across 500 sampled materials, "looks metallic" vs. log-density correlates inside
the band `0.3 < r < 0.99` — predictive enough to learn, noisy enough that it
can't be a lookup table. (Guarded by a test.)

### F3 — The full model trains (gradients flow end to end)
The torch overfit smoke (encoder + all three heads, incl. the render decoder)
drops loss ~4.8–4.9× in 200 steps on a fixed batch. This proves the architecture
is differentiable and wired correctly — **not** that it learns generalizable
physics.

### F4 — In-sandbox scale ceiling (full model, incl. render head)

| case | img | views | params | ms/step | peak RSS | loss (overfit) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tiny | 32 | 4 | 0.07M | 15.8 | 328 MB | 0.449→0.304 |
| small | 64 | 8 | 0.19M | 49.9 | 379 MB | 0.430→0.198 |
| medium | 128 | 12 | 0.41M | 268 | 668 MB | 0.416→0.180 |
| **large** | **128** | **16** | **1.01M** | **847** | **913 MB** | **0.420→0.114** |
| xl | 256 | 8 | 1.02M | 2357 | 1309 MB | 0.430→0.126 |

Comfortable to **~1M params / 128px / 16 views** (sub-second–~0.85 s/step) for
correctness + convergence checks. Past 256px, CPU step time makes real training
impractical — confirming MLX/Metal on the Mac as the canonical trainer. **Memory
is never the bound** (peak 1.3 of 15 GB); compute time is.

### F5 — The coherence metric had a subtle bug, now fixed
Unit-sphere perturbation directions make two *disjoint* latent subspaces
anti-correlated (a simplex artifact), so an independent baseline would score
*negative* instead of ~0. Fixed to **iid Gaussian directions**; a test locks it.

### F6 — ⭐ The shared-vs-independent gap is mostly architectural, not learned
Running the harness on **untrained** numpy models:

```
shared_coherence        0.4565
independent_coherence    0.0076   ← "glued together" control, ~0 as expected
architectural_coherence  0.3591   ← a second untrained shared init
```

An **untrained** shared model already scores ~0.45 coherence — purely because
both heads read the same `z`. So a naive "shared beats independent" result would
be an **architectural artifact, not evidence of a learned eigenvector**. Had we
run that comparison on the Mac and seen a big gap, we'd have falsely "confirmed"
the hypothesis.

The honest signal is therefore:

> **`learned_coherence = trained_shared − untrained_shared`**, averaged over
> several untrained seeds (the baseline itself varies ~0.36–0.46), evaluated on
> **held-out essence regions**, and paired with **behavior generalization**.

This control is baked into `compare()`. The apparatus caught this *before* any
Mac time was spent — arguably the most valuable sandbox finding. Its logic
(subtract the architectural prior, keep the residual) is the same move predictive
coding makes for a prediction error — see
[`PREDICTIVE_CODING.md`](PREDICTIVE_CODING.md).

### F7 — Per-probe difficulty (methodology illustration)

Which behavior outputs are hard to predict from appearance? Real per-field
difficulty needs the MuJoCo run, but training the *actual* torch model on a
synthetic toy-physics stand-in shows the apparatus and the expected ordering:

![per-probe difficulty](figures/probe_difficulty.png)

Smooth outcomes (settle time, max height) are easiest; **toppling is hardest** —
it is a bimodal threshold (tips or it doesn't), so a regression head cannot land
cleanly near the tipping point (the "chaos near tipping points" risk from
`BEHAVIOR_TASK.md`, made visible). The model beats a predict-the-mean baseline on
every field. The *numbers* are from a synthetic stand-in
(`scripts/figure_probe_difficulty.py`); the real ordering comes from the Mac run.

---

### F8 — ⭐ First real-MuJoCo result: the topple label is locally chaotic but the contamination is bounded — and degenerate for half the shapes

This is the **first empirical result from real MuJoCo on the Mac** (not a synthetic
stand-in), produced by `tests/batch_probe_stability.py` (pure-sim, no rendering,
~5 s). It de-risks the behavior labels before training, directly testing the
"chaos near tipping points" risk in `docs/BEHAVIOR_TASK.md`. The PUSH probe records
`toppled = final_tilt_deg > 50°` — a hard threshold.

**The sim is deterministic.** Same `(shape, material)` run 3× ⇒ max field diff
`0`. So the docs' "average over seeds" mitigation cannot work by re-running a
scene; it requires injecting initial-condition / action jitter.

**Chaos is real, sharp, and localised to the crossover** (sweeping heaviness→density
at grip=0.5, hardness=0.3). The cylinder — the docs' canonical "tall topples where
squat slides" case — flips from upright to over across a near-step transition
(slope ≈ 2160°/heaviness-unit at crossover h≈0.23). Under a **3% push-impulse
jitter** (24 reps), the binary label's flip-rate is:

| location (cylinder) | p_topple | flip-rate | final_tilt |
|---|---|---|---|
| far_light (h=0.00) | 1.00 | 0.00 | 90.0 ± 0.0° |
| **near boundary (h=0.23)** | **0.33** | **0.33** | **31.5 ± 41.3°** |
| far_heavy (h=0.53) | 0.00 | 0.00 | 0.0 ± 0.0° |

A tiny action difference flips the label ~⅓ of the time **only** at the crossover;
30% away on either side it is rock-stable (σ=0°). Chaos is a thin shell, not a fog.

**But `toppled` is degenerate for half the shape set** (multi-seed population,
5 seeds × 200 scenes, the generator's own sampler):

| shape | topple_rate (mean ± std) | label class |
|---|---|---|
| box | 0.000 ± 0.000 | **never** (always slides) |
| capsule | 1.000 ± 0.000 | **always** (rolls onto its side) |
| sphere | 0.447 ± 0.101 | **ill-posed** (no upright pose; tilt just measures rolling) |
| cylinder | 0.244 ± 0.047 | genuine boundary |
| ellipsoid | 0.062 ± 0.033 | genuine boundary |

So the topple bit carries **zero learnable signal for box/capsule** (a constant)
and is **meaningless for the sphere** (rotational symmetry → arbitrary final
orientation). It is a genuine, non-degenerate target only for the cylinder and
ellipsoid — and that is exactly where it is chaotic.

**The contamination is bounded** (fraction of all scenes within a deadband of the
50° threshold, multi-seed): `±5°: 0.017 ± 0.015`, `±10°: 0.030 ± 0.018`,
`±15°: 0.043 ± 0.021`. Only ~2–4% of sampled scenes sit in the ambiguous band;
overall topple_rate `0.357 ± 0.033`.

**Implications for the experiment** (to decide before the coherence run, not yet
applied):
- Prefer the **continuous `final_tilt_deg`** over the binary `toppled` (no
  threshold discontinuity), or replace `toppled` with a **jitter-averaged soft
  topple probability** — a well-defined, smooth target.
- `toppled`'s degeneracy means a behavior head can score "well" on it for free
  (box/capsule) or be supervised by noise (sphere). When reading per-field
  behavior MSE and `learned_coherence`, treat `push.toppled` separately — consider
  reporting coherence with and without it, and excluding the sphere from
  topple-based analysis.
- The smooth fields (settle_time, max_height, slid_distance, …) are unaffected.

Reproduce: `python tests/batch_probe_stability.py` (writes
`runs/stability/probe_stability.json` with the raw sweep arrays for plotting).

### F9 — ⭐ Coherence experiment: a weak, seed-UNSTABLE positive — the multi-seed run CORRECTS the single-seed pilot

This is the project's headline measurement, run properly. **The honest verdict:
training raises render↔physics coherence modestly above both baselines *on
average*, but the effect is small and swings wildly with the training seed — it is
NOT (yet) evidence of a reliable shared eigenvector.** A single-seed pilot badly
overstated it; this entry is the correction.

Setup: dataset `pm_big` — 512 scenes, 8 views, 128px, **extrapolation** holdout
(heavy+bouncy corner), 492 train / **20 test**. **5 shared seeds** (50 epochs each)
+ a **render-only** and a **physics-only** model (per-head loss weights) for the
independent control. Coherence on the held-out region (48 dirs); architectural
baseline over 5 fresh untrained inits. `scripts/run_coherence_experiment.py`.

| target | trained (5 seeds) | architectural (5 seeds) | independent (disjoint-latent) | learned = trained − arch |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| behavior | 0.276 **± 0.166** | 0.109 ± 0.029 | 0.030 | +0.168 (within seed noise) |
| essence  | 0.261 **± 0.157** | 0.096 ± 0.021 | 0.046 | +0.165 (within seed noise) |

**What holds:** the ordering **independent (~0.04) < architectural (~0.10) <
trained (~0.27 avg)** is real — the disjoint-latent ~0 control works, and trained
models sit above both baselines on average.

**What breaks the strong claim:** trained coherence is **enormously seed-unstable**
— essence ranges **0.10 → 0.49**, behavior **0.17 → 0.60** across the 5 seeds. The
trained std (~0.16) is as large as the gain. Crucially the architectural baseline's
std on the *same* 20 scenes and directions is only ~0.03, so the spread is **genuine
training-seed variance, not measurement noise**: some inits learn the coupling, some
don't. By mean ± std the learned gain is *within* the cross-seed band (t≈2.2, n=5 —
marginal, not significant).

**The correction.** The earlier provisional pilot (`pm_mid`, single seed 0) reported
essence learned **+0.369 at ~7.7σ**. That was a lucky draw: on `pm_big` the **seed-0**
model gives essence coherence **0.110** — right at the untrained baseline. Multi-seed
collapses the headline to +0.165 and reclassifies it as marginal. The pilot's other
"tell" was also atypical: its participation ratio was 61.7 (vs untrained 7.6); across
the 5 `pm_big` seeds it is **10.8 vs 8.3** — the trained models barely spread the
representation here.

**A precise sub-finding:** prediction quality is **stable** across seeds (held-out
behavior MSE 0.032–0.051, all modestly beating predict-mean) while representational
**coupling is not**. The heads *predict* consistently; whether they *share structure*
depends on initialization. Coupling of direction (when it appears) without reliable
accuracy on the extrapolation corner.

**Open:** more seeds (10–20) to settle significance; longer training / larger
held-out set; investigate the init-sensitivity (loss-landscape basins, or the F8
behavior-label noise). Reproduce: train the 7 models (`runs/big/*`), then
`python scripts/run_coherence_experiment.py --data data/pm_big --checkpoints
runs/big/shared_s0/model.safetensors,…,shared_s4/… --render-only
runs/big/render_only/model.safetensors --physics-only
runs/big/physics_only/model.safetensors` (writes `runs/big_coherence/coherence_report.json`).

## 3. What is NOT yet known (honest gaps)

- **The learned coupling is real on average but not yet reliable.** F9 measured
  `learned_coherence` ≈ **+0.165** above baseline on real renders, but it is
  **seed-unstable** (essence 0.10–0.49 across 5 inits) and statistically marginal
  (t≈2.2, n=5). It is a weak positive, not a confirmed shared eigenvector — more
  seeds (10–20), longer training, and a larger held-out set are needed to settle
  significance.
- **Why initialization decides coupling is unexplained.** Prediction quality is
  *stable* across seeds while representational *coupling* is not (F9). The open
  question is what separates the inits that couple from those that don't —
  loss-landscape basins, or the F8 behavior-label noise.
- **The coupling is authored.** MuJoCo/Blender decouple appearance and physics, so
  we are (at best) learning the *generator's* eigenvector, not reality's. The GSO
  experiment (`docs/GSO_EXPERIMENT.md`) is the parked route to real measured data.
- **The clean-label coherence run hasn't been done.** `push.toppled` is degenerate
  for box/capsule and ill-posed for the sphere (F8); the jitter-averaged soft-topple
  label exists (`--topple-jitter-reps`) but hasn't been pushed through a full
  coherence experiment. The smooth fields (settle_time, max_height, …) are
  unaffected.

---

## 4. Next steps — the result is in; now harden it

F8 (label stability) and F9 (the coherence experiment) have both been run on the
Mac (MLX/Metal). What remains is to firm up the marginal F9 positive and to escape
authored coupling:

1. **More seeds (10–20)** to settle whether the +0.165 learned gain clears the
   cross-seed band; pair with a larger held-out region and longer training.
2. **Investigate init-sensitivity** — why some inits couple and some don't (F9).
3. **Re-run with cleaner labels** — the soft-topple probability
   (`--topple-jitter-reps`) and/or `push.toppled` excluded and the sphere dropped
   (F8) — to see whether less label noise steadies the coupling.
4. **GSO** — real measured objects, to test reality's coupling rather than the
   generator's (`docs/GSO_EXPERIMENT.md`).

Reproduce F9: train the 7 models (`runs/big/*`), then

```bash
python scripts/run_coherence_experiment.py --data data/pm_big \
    --checkpoints runs/big/shared_s0/model.safetensors,…,shared_s4/model.safetensors \
    --render-only runs/big/render_only/model.safetensors \
    --physics-only runs/big/physics_only/model.safetensors
# writes runs/big_coherence/coherence_report.json
```

Reproduce F8: `python tests/batch_probe_stability.py`.
